## Steps Involed

**Data Preprocessing:** The project includes scripts to clean and prepare text data, using techniques like converting text to lowercase, removing special characters and stop words, and lemmatization.

**Model Development:** The project uses machine learning and deep learning models for sentiment analysis. The models are trained and evaluated on a dataset of reviews.

**Evaluation:** The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Technologies Used

**Python:** The primary programming language used for the project.

**scikit-learn:** For traditional machine learning models.

**NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** For various NLP tasks.

**Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation and numerical operations.

**Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.



## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MahadhevanS/Sentiment-Analyser-model
